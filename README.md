# :smiley_cat: All about Tomcat

> Server v/s Web Server v/s Servlet Container

---

### **1. Key Terms**
#### **a) Server:**
   - A **server** is just a powerful computer (or software) that "serves" requests. 
   - Example: When you visit `google.com`, your browser (client) asks Google’s server for the webpage.

#### **b) Web Server:**
   - A **web server** handles **HTTP requests** (like GET, POST) and serves static content (HTML, CSS, images).
   - Example: **Apache HTTP Server**, **Nginx**.
   - *Limitation*: It can’t run Java code dynamically.

#### **c) Servlet:**
   - A **Servlet** is a Java class that runs on a server to handle dynamic requests (e.g., processing form data, talking to a database).
   - Example: If you login to a website, a Servlet might check your username/password.

#### **d) Container:**
   - A **container** is like a "runtime environment" that manages components (e.g., Servlets). It provides them with resources, lifecycle management, and security.
   - Think of it like an **OS for Servlets** – it starts, stops, and manages them.

---

### **2. What is Tomcat?**
**Apache Tomcat** is a **Servlet Container** (also called a *web container* or *Servlet engine*).  
- It’s a server that can **run Java Servlets** (dynamic Java code).
- It also includes a basic **HTTP web server**, so it can serve static files too (but it’s not as powerful as Nginx/Apache HTTP Server).

#### **Tomcat’s Job:**
1. **Listens** for HTTP requests (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).
2. **Routes** requests to the correct Servlet (Java code).
3. **Manages** Servlets (starts, stops, multithreading, security).
4. **Sends back** the dynamic response (e.g., HTML generated by Java).

---

### **3. Why is Tomcat Everywhere?**
Tomcat is lightweight, free, and widely used. Here’s why you see it in:
- **Grails/Spring MVC**: These frameworks use Servlets internally. Tomcat runs them.
- **Spring Boot**: Embeds Tomcat by default (no separate install needed) to simplify deployment.

---

### **4. Key Takeaways**
- Tomcat = **Servlet Container** + **Basic Web Server**.
- It runs **Java Servlets** (dynamic code).
- Frameworks like Spring Boot **embed Tomcat** so you don’t need to set it up separately.
- Alternatives: Jetty, Undertow (similar to Tomcat but with different features).

---

### **5. Example Flow (Tomcat in Action)**
1. You visit `http://localhost:8080/login`.
2. Tomcat (web server part) receives the request.
3. Tomcat (container part) finds the `LoginServlet` Java class.
4. `LoginServlet` runs, checks your credentials in a database.
5. Tomcat sends back the response (e.g., "Welcome, User!").

---

### **6. Summary**
- **Tomcat** = A server that runs Java Servlets (dynamic web apps).
- **Servlet** = Java class handling HTTP requests.
- **Container** = Manages Servlets’ lifecycle.

> So can I create a simple Java Servlet & run it on Web server ? I don't want to use Tomcat so that I understand Servlets independently. 


**Servlets cannot run without a Servlet Container** (like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow). A Servlet is just a Java class, but it needs a container to:  
- Handle HTTP requests/responses.  
- Manage the Servlet lifecycle (`init()`, `service()`, `destroy()`).  
- Provide threading, security, and deployment features.

> Would like to know how Containers manage Servlets ?


Let’s break down **how a Servlet Container (like Tomcat or Jetty) manages Servlets** in a way that’s easy to visualize. Think of the container as a "backstage manager" for your Servlets, handling everything from birth to death, multitasking, and even emergencies.
